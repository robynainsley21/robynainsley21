# Hi! I'm Robyn 👋


## 🚀 About Me

👩‍💻 I am Robyn Carnow, a graduate and currently pursuing a career in web development.

📖 When I'm not bleary-eyed and debugging, I turn to a book. My favorite genres are thrillers, non-fiction and personal development. One of my favorite reads is the famous Atomic Habits by James Clear.

💃Outside of work, I love to travel to places with friends and family. A goal of mine is to one day travel outside of the country and explore different cultures.
